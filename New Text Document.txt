Technical Stack and Project Structure
---------------------------------------------------
Backend (Spring Boot):

Spring Boot: Core framework for building the application.
Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Spring MVC: For building REST APIs.
Spring Boot DevTools: For faster development.
Lombok: For reducing boilerplate code.
JUnit and Mockito: For testing.
---------------------------------------------------------
Frontend (Angular):

Angular: A powerful framework for building dynamic web applications.
Angular Material: For pre-built UI components.
Angular Router: For routing between different views.
Angular HttpClient: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
RxJS: For handling asynchronous operations.
TypeScript: For strong typing and better code maintainability.

Implementation Steps
Backend Development:

Database Design: Create a database schema with entities like User, Project, Task, and Comment.
Spring Boot Application: Set up a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies.
Security Configuration: Configure Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
REST API Development: Create REST APIs for user management, project management, task management, and comment management.
Service Layer: Implement service classes to handle business logic.
Repository Layer: Implement repository interfaces to interact with the database.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
Frontend Development:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angular Project Setup: Create a new Angular project.
Component Structure: Create components for login, registration, dashboard, user management, project management, task management, and comments.
Routing: Configure Angular Router to handle navigation between different views.
HTTP Requests: Use Angular HttpClient to make HTTP requests to the backend API.
UI Development: Use Angular Material to create a user-friendly UI with forms, tables, and other components.
State Management: Consider using NgRx or Redux for managing application state.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests for Angular components.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment:

Dockerize the Application: Create Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend.
Docker Compose: Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the deployment of the backend and frontend services.
Deployment to Cloud: Deploy to a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Considerations:
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
Security: Protect sensitive data using encryption and secure communication protocols.
Performance Optimization: Optimize database queries, frontend performance, and API calls.
Scalability: Design the application to handle increasing load and future growth.
Testing: Write comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
